# Tic-tac-toe-Player-vs-AI-
This was my first AI project where I made a simple tic-tac-toe game.
Point of this game is that player will never win and the best result he can get is a draw.
Computer always knows what move to make in order to win or make a draw.

# NOTE
Code is written in Croatian language and it needs to be updated to English language.
